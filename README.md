## API key safety:

FriedGPT takes advantage of API keys for privacy and safety. All of the code is open source.
If you're concerned, please take the following precautions:

To secure your API key perform the following steps:

1. Make sure you have a separate API key for FriedGPT
2. Set up billing limit
3. Enable usage monitoring, so you can see what FriedGPT is doing and how much it costs
