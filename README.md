## API key safety:

FriedGPT takes advantage of API keys for privacy and safety. All of the code is open source.
If you're concerned, please take advantage of the following steps?

To secure your API key perform the following steps:

1. Make sure you have separate API key for FriedGPT
2. Set up billing limit
3. Enable usage monitoring, so you can see how much resources FriedGPT uses and how much it costs
4. If you have any concerns you can revoke your API key
